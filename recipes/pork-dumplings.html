        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>ground pork</li>
            <li>garlic, minced</li>
            <Li> onion, sliced</Li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li> sesame oil</li>
            <li> egg, beaten</li>
            <li> chinese cabbage, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
